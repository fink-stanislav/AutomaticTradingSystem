# I. Definition

## Project Overview

Algorithmic trading attracted many researchers in recent years. Their goal is to create software that
is able to trade autonomously and profitably. Most of the works and projects are focused on
traditional stock markets ([D. W. Lu](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07338v1), [Wang et al](http://cslt.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/mediawiki/images/5/5f/Dtq.pdf)) or fiat currency markets while this project is focused on cryptocurrency
market.

A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to
secure the transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of
assets. [Cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) are classified as a subset of digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.

Cryptocurrency market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where trading of
cryptocurrencies and [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering) takes place, either through formal exchanges or over-the-counter markets.

Cryptocurrency market is much more volatile than stock market. Volatility of stock market is
summarized by [VIX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX/) index and is around 16% a year for now. Volatility of cryptocurrency market is not summarized by commonly accepted index. But still there are quite illustrative indices e.g. [SIFR Volatility Index](https://www.sifrdata.com/cryptocurrency-volatility-index/), it is around 150% for now.

Increased volatility creates more buy and sell opportunities and therefore such market is more
[suitable](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/010915/volatility-good-thing-or-bad-thing-investors-point-view-and-why.asp) for short-term technical analysis based trading.

Stock and fiat currencies markets differs from cryptocurrency market in terms of regulation, volatility and risk of market manipulation but the basic idea is the same. Therefore approaches that were discussed in stock market related works should also be suitable for cryptocurrency market.
